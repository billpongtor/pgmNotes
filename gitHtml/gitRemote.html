      <h1>how to use git with a remote repository</h1>
<p><br />
The git command works very well with a remote repository.<br />
For the purpose of this topic,  we will use github.com as our remote repository example.<br />
Important elements needed for the use of github.com are the following:<br /><br />
1.  An account on github.com.  This will give us an account name,  plus the associated password.<br /><br />
2.  A repository created in the respective github.com account.  The complete https url will be<br />
    required to establish the location of the remote repository with git.  Github.com has tools<br />
    that allow the user to obtain that information easily.<br /><br />
