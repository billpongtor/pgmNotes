      <h1>how to use git with a remote repository</h1>
<p><br />
The git command works very well with a remote repository.  For the purpose of this topic,<br />
we will use github.com as our remote repository example.  Important elements needed for the use of github.com are the following:<br /><br />
1.  An account on github.com.  This will give us an account name,  plus the associated password.<br /><br />
2.  A repository created in the respective github.com account.  The complete https url will be required to establish the location<br />
of the remote repository with git.  github.com has tools that allow the user to obtain that information easily.<br /><br />
'git' must be configured with your username and user email before proceding to do any remote work.<br />
'git config --global user.name "username" sets the git username.<br />
'git config --global user.email "useremail" sets the git user email address.<br />
Examples:<br />
git config --global user.name "billpongtor" (my github username)<br />
git config --global user.email "bill.pong.tor@gmail.com" (my gmail address)<br /><br />
The remotes URL must be set before pushing local repo to the remote repo.  github.com has tools to copy the repos url address directly<br />
to the desktops clipboard.  After the url address has been copied, the basic git command to set the remote URL is the following:<br /><br />
'git remote add origin urlAddress' (paste in the url address)<br /><br />
Confirm that the url address has been set by using command 'git remote -v' (verifying the url setting).<br />
Once the origin has been setup,  then the command to push files to the remote repo is the following:<br /><br />
'git push origin master'<br /><br />
'origin' is the url that has been set using 'git remote set-url origin urlAddress'.  'master' is the working branch located in the local workstation.<br />
The git push command will copy the 'prestaged' files to the remote repository.<br /><br />
